# Introduction

Welcome to the **ParaDiGM** library introductory day !

The aim of the day is to give you : 
 - An overview of **ParaDiGM**'s features
 - An understanding of **ParaDiGM**'s advanced parallelism concepts
 - An understanding of how **ParaDiGM** can be called in your software written in C/C++, Fortran or Python.

This is an interactive course, so don't hesitate to interrupt us to ask your questions.

The training will take place in three stages:
- General presentation of **ParaDiGM**
- Description of the abstract concept of inter-partition communication graphs
- Focus on two functionalities through interactive exercises :
    - Exercise 1 : Mesh partitioning
    - Exercise 2 : Localization of a point cloud inside a mesh

# **ParaDiGM** highlights

## Origins of **ParaDiGM**

From 2009 to 2015, various HPC libraries dedicated to different themes were written. **ppart** for parallel graph partitioning, **pario** for parallel I/O as a wrapping to MPI-IO, **CWIPI** for HPC coupling... These libraries shared many principles and structures and were complementary. The idea of merging these libraries into a single one emerged in 2016.  **ParaDiGM** was born!

As the **CWIPI** library was already well used in the academic and industrial communities, it was retained, but its entire algorithmic core was replaced by **ParaDiGM**.

## Objectives

An efficient parallel algorithm takes much longer to write and validate than a sequential one. A simple sequential operation can become very difficult if you want to maintain good *load* and *memory* balancing during all algorithm steps.

<img src="paradigm.png" width="1000">

**ParaDiGM** aims to offer a set of efficient services to simplify the writing of massively parallel distributed numerical simulation software, from reading data files to writing results.
<span style="color:red">Numerical codes are generally based on a discretization of the study domain which can take the form of a mesh.
**ParaDiGM** only offers services for unstructured meshes. (on garde partie Mesh après??)</span>

## API

The API has been designed to be as user-friendly and intuitive as possible. All functionalities are in object form. To use a feature, the user **creates** an object and then **provides** the necessary data in the form of arrays and scalars. Once all the data has been provided, the user executes the feature **compute**. As with data, results are **retrieved** in the form of arrays or **ParaDiGM** objects. All concrete results required by the user are obtained directly by dedicated functions, without the need for abstract intermediate structures. User manipulation of abstract **ParaDiGM** objects is reduced to a strict minimum.

The native API is in C and can be used in C/C++ software.

Two other APIs are available. The first one is in Python/Numpy, automatically generated from Cython, and the second one is in Fortran using Fortran's *iso-c-binding* interfaces. These APIs are not simply direct interfaces to C functions. They have been designed to be user-friendly and intuitive in each language.
<span style="color:darkorange;">Feel free to give us feedback so that we can improve ourselves !</span>
The Python API reinforces the notion of objects, and results are provided in the form of dictionaries. The Fortran API takes Fortran pointers as input/output and not `c_ptr` types with which Fortran developers are unfamiliar. The C API contains pointer arrays. This notion is not defined in Fortran. When giving data or retrieving results in this form, the user must use the Fortran **pdm_pointer_array** intermediate structure.

## **ParaDiGM**'s position within the ONERA ecosystem

<img src="ecosystem.png" width="1000">

## Organization

Work has been carried out to develop the library with a workflow that takes advantage of modern software development tools.
**ParaDiGM** is available through [GitLab](https://gitlab.onera.net/numerics/mesh/paradigm) for ONERA users/developers and there is a git repository available for external users.
We work on making the library available on GitHub.
Using GitLab allows us to use GitLab CI which is a continuous method of software development. At each commit on the repository,
it checks whether the library builds and passes the test base successfully.

<img src="CI.png" width="600">

The recent increase in the number of developers has made it possible to devote a significant amount of time to developing [documentation](https://numerics.gitlab-pages.onera.net/mesh/paradigm/dev_formation/index.html) with Sphinx.
This is still a work in progress, so we welcome your comments and contributions!

## Application examples

<img src="cwipiNew.svg" align=right style="margin: 0px 50px;" width="100">

### Geometric core for code coupling : CWIPI

The CWIPI library has been created by Eric Quémerais in 2009.

- What for ?

The purpose of this LGPL library is to couple codes in a massively parallel distributed setting.
It provides tools to define code coupling algorithms to control each exchange between the codes.
It does the transfer of interpolated fields through a geometric coupling interface.

- Why use ParaDiGM ?

Formerly, CWIPI used the LGPL *FVM* library developed at EDF R&D for geometrical computations.
To expand the range of spatial interpolation algorithms available and answer user feedback, CWIPI has been rewritten and relies on *ParaDiGM* since *version 1.0* (released in July 2023).

- Which ParaDiGM features are used ?

The spatial interpolation algorithms available in CWIPI to interpolated the fields exchange at the coupling interface have been developped in ParaDiGM.
Those are : `PDM_mesh_location`, `PDM_mesh_intersection` and `PDM_closest_points`. This means that if you need to do an interpolation operation out of a coupling setting you can directly call this functions from ParaDiGM.

- Where ?

  - https://gitlab.onera.net/numerics/coupling/cwipi (ONERA users only)
  - https://w3.onera.fr/cwipi/bibliotheque-couplage-cwipi (in French)
  - on GitHub (in progress)

### Python/CGNS interface : MAIA

TO DO

### Use of low level features : MCC in CEDRE

This work is being carried out by Philippe Grenard.

- What for ?

The aim of the MCC feature is to slice a background volume by the contour of a masking mesh.
This means that the cells need to be taged whether they are hidden, cut or visible with respect to the masking mesh.
Once that is done, a communication graph on the interface between the sliced background and the masking mesh needs to be created.

- How was it formerly done ?

A multisequential algorithm was implemented. Indeed, the surface mesh was duplicated on all the MPI ranks.
Then the sequential slicing algorithm was run on all MPI ranks. Then global communications were used to bring the result on to all MPI ranks (MPI_all_gather).

- Why change ?

Because the memory cost exploded on large cases.
The goal was thus to rewrite the feature leaving most of the data on their source MPI rank and create a load balanced algorithm.

- What are the hardships for legacy codes ?

Using an external library in a legacy code to incrementally replace an existing feature while ensuring a minimum of non-regression can be complicated due to fixed complex data structures.
Since the MCC feature is not yet widely used in CEDRE, it was easier to decide to recast it using an external library.

- Why use ParaDiGM ?

Developing parallel algorithms requires a high level of HPC expertise.
Since the functions needed to develop this algorithm were (almost) present in ParaDiGM, it was easily available.

- Which ParaDiGM features are used ?

  - `PDM_gnum` to build the final unique global numbering
  - `PDM_global_reduce` to estimate a characteristic mesh size at the vertices
  - `PDM_extract_part` to extract the mesh area of interest
  - `PDM_mesh_intersection` to operate the masking mesh intersection with the background volume mesh
  - `PDM_part_to_part` to change data between those meshes

## Concepts and definition

### Mesh

Most computational methods rely on a *mesh* for the spatial discretization of partial differential equations.
If you are not familiar with this notion, here's a quick recap.

A mesh is composed of entities of different dimensions. The following terminology is used in **ParaDiGM** :
- **cells**: 3D entities such as tetrahedra, pyramids, prisms, hexahedra or arbitrary polyhedra ;
- **faces**: 2D entities such as triangles, quadrangles or arbitrary (simply connected) polygons ;
- **edges**: 1D entities (segment between two points) ;
- **vertices** (*shortened as "**vtx**"*): points defined by their Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$.

A mesh can either be *structured* or *unstructured*.

| Structured mesh | Unstructured mesh |
|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
|<img align="center" width="300" height="300" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;" src="mesh_struct.svg">|<img align="center" width="300" height="300" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;" src="mesh_unstruct.svg">|



In a structured mesh, all entities are arranged in a regular grid.
Adjacency relations between these entities are therefore implicit : face $F_{i,j}$ is adjacent to faces $F_{i-1,j}$, $F_{i+1,j}$, $F_{i,j-1}$, and $F_{i,j+1}$.

Unstructured meshes, however, require an explicit description of the connectivity between mesh entities.

**ParaDiGM** deals essentially with *unstructured* meshes.

The entities and connectivities of interest depend on the numerical method.
For example, Finite Element methods typically only require the cell$\to$vertex connectivity (and face$\to$vtx for boundary faces).
On the other hand, cell-centered Finite Volume methods generally require the cell$\to$face and face$\to$vtx connectivities.
Other method, such as node-centered Finite Volume methods may also require the connectivities relative to the edges.

In **ParaDiGM** all connectivities are stored as *1-based*, possibly signed, *flat* arrays.
Because each entity $A$ may be connected to a variable number of entities $B$, an **index** is necessary to access the array $\texttt{connect}$ representing the connectivity $A \to B$.
This index is an array $\texttt{connect\_idx}$ of length $n_A + 1$ which contains the ranges, i.e. the entities $B$ connected to $A_i$ are given by $ \texttt{connect}[j]$, for $j \in \left[ \texttt{connect\_idx}[i], \texttt{connect\_idx}[i+1] \right)$.
The first element in the index array is always zero, and the last element is the length of the connectivity array.

*Note that edges can only have two endpoints, so the index for the edge$\to$vtx is useless.*


##### **<span style="color:SlateBlue">Note to Fortran users</span>**
*<span style="color:SlateBlue">
Because arrays are usually indexed starting from one, you should instead read :
the entities $B$ connected to $A_i$ are given by $ \texttt{connect}[j]$, for $j \in \left( \texttt{connect\_idx}[i], \texttt{connect\_idx}[i+1] \right]$.
</span>*

Let's take a look at a simple example to illustrate the notion we just introduced:

<img width="120" height="120" style="margin: 0px 30px 20px 30px;" src="house.svg">


Here we have a simple mesh composed of 3 faces and 9 vertices.
Let's see if you can guess what the face$\to$vtx connectivity and index arrays look like...

+++ {"jupyter": {"source_hidden": true}}
Solution:
The face$\to$vtx connectivity and its index are
\begin{flalign}
  \texttt{face\_vtx\_idx} & =  [0, 4, 12, 15]&&\\\nonumber
  \texttt{face\_vtx}      & =  [{\color{red}2, 3, 6, 5}, {\color{green}1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 7}, {\color{blue}7, 8, 9}]&&
\end{flalign}

<!-- <code>
  face_vtx_idx = [0, 4, 12, 15]
  face_vtx     = [<span style="color:red">2, 3, 6, 5</span>, <span style="color:green;">1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 7</span>, <span style="color:blue">7, 8, 9</span>]
</code> -->

<!-- $$face_vtx = [\underbrace{2, 3, 6, 5}_{face 1}, \quad \underbrace{1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 7}_{face 2}, \quad \underbrace{7, 8, 9}_{face 3} ]$$
 -->

+++





Vertices are described by the $3 \cdot n_\mathrm{vtx}$ *flat* array of the Cartesian coordinates. The coordinates are stored in an *interlaced* fashion:
$\left(x_0, y_0, z_0, x_1, y_1, z_1, \ldots \right)$.

*Note that in **ParaDiGM** coordinates are always assumed to be three-dimensional, even for 2D, planar meshes.*


##### **<span style="color:SlateBlue">Note to Fortran users</span>**
*<span style="color:SlateBlue">
Coordinates are stored as rank-2 arrays with shape $[3, n_\mathrm{vtx}]$.
</span>*


#### You want more?

**ParaDiGM** features more advanced mesh-related capabilities.
Most notably, some mesh entities can be organized into **groups**, that come handy for instance to represent the different boundary conditions.
It is also worth mentioning that **ParaDiGM** supports high-order, curved meshes.
These more advanced notions go beyond the scope of this training so we will not focus on them today.

## MPI parallel distributed algorithms

The aim of this section is to help you understand the reason for the ParaDiGM's performance by walking you through the main concepts.

### Block-distributed approach

*<span style="color:olivedrab;">
How is a mesh read in parallel?
</span>*

In this section we will study the block-distributed approach will having a look at how a parallel mesh read is done.
We will do this as an interactive game. Some of you have a number on your table.
This number represents the identifier of an MPI rank.
On the front table, we have laid out tokens representating mesh data stored in a file.
In ascending order, a representative of each MPI rank will collect an equitably distributed number of tokens.

*<span style="color:olivedrab;">
How many tokens will each rank get?
</span>*

Once each MPI rank has read the mesh data assigned to them, the parallel mesh read is completed.
They way the data is distributed is what we call *block-distributed*.
Now you can flip you tokens.

*<span style="color:olivedrab;">
What particularity of the block-distributed approach can you see?
</span>*

Ask the other representatives of MPI ranks which tokens they have. By doing so, you will notice that the number identifing each token appears only once.
This *unicity* turns out to be handy for parallel data sorting, a core tool for parallel algorithms.

*<span style="color:olivedrab;">
What do this numbers on your tokens represent?
</span>*

### Global IDs and the partitionned approach

Each piece of data (here a mesh element) is asociated to a unique number representing it in the data set over all MPI ranks.

To be used in a numerical simulation, the mesh we just read need to be partitionned.
We will hand out tokens of an other color representing the elements of the partitionned mesh.

*<span style="color:olivedrab;">
What is the particularity of the token distribution for a partitionned mesh?
</span>*

Ask the other representatives of MPI ranks which tokens they have. There have no elements in common.
Now have a look at the global identifiers of the vertices on the elements on your token.
It turns out that on the partition boundaries of the partitionned mesh there are vertices in common.

A mesh in the *partitionned* approach is a coherent sub-mesh on each MPI rank while in the *block-distributed* approach the vertices on a given MPI rank are most often not linked to the mesh elements on that MPI rank.

*Remark : We never asked you to discard the tokens of the block-distributed vision. This is because they will coexist in memory.*

### A parallel context with a multisequential algorithm

Now that the mesh is partitionned, it is time to work with it.
The representatives of each MPI rank will compute for each the elements of the tokens in their pocession the maximum value of the vertices of that element.

*<span style="color:olivedrab;">
Was this a parallely well balanced task?
</span>*

Yes, since the mesh partitionning allowed each MPI rank to have an equally distributed number of elements of the mesh.
Still, this is a multisequential algorithm comparable to the one formerly done for the MCC feature.

*<span style="color:olivedrab;">
Why bother to change for a load balanced algorithm?
</span>*

### A parallel context with a load balanced algorithm

Now we ask you to compute $\sum_{i=0}^{n\_element\_vertices} (\sqrt{vtx\_global\_number[i]} + \prod_{i=0}^{42} vtx\_global\_number[i]^{9})$ for each the elements of the tokens.
This task only needs to be done the MPI ranks pocessing the elements in the lower half of the mesh.

*<span style="color:olivedrab;">
Whould you rather charge this task with representatives of other ranks or do it on your own while they have nothing to do?
</span>*

To do such a tedious task, you'd like to get your fellow MPI rank representatives to work.

*<span style="color:olivedrab;">
Is is worth to bring them the data they need to help you out rather than just to it on your own?
</span>*

It turns out that if the workload is sufficient it is worth to do this communication to speed up the computation.
This is the setting for most geometric operations.
Even if the partitioning were already well balanced for the operation, the overload of the load balancing is minimal.
In most cases, this approach is a winner !

## Features overview

### MPI communication wrapper tools

##### **<span style="color:darkorange;">Note</span>**
*<span style="color:darkorange;">
Advanced feature. Used in ParaDiGM algorithm development.
</span>*

As you have seen with the game earlier, the block-distributed and partitioned point of view are key in parallel load balanced algorithms.
That for it is paramount to be able to easily switch between those two.
`PDM_part_to_block` and `PDM_block_to_part` are low level tools to wrap the creation of MPI communication graphs.

It arised that we needed a function to link partitions in order to exchange fields.
This particularly is at stake at the end ParaDiGM algorithms to make a link between the partitionned input mesh data and the partitionned output mesh data.
This is the `PDM_part_to_part` function. You will use it at the end of the day in the last exercise.

### Preconditioning geometric algorithms using trees

##### **<span style="color:darkorange;">Note</span>**
*<span style="color:darkorange;">
Advanced feature. Used in ParaDiGM algorithm development.
</span>*

<img src="octree.png" width="150" align="left" style="margin: 0px 30px 0px 30px;">

<br/>

The performance in the features in ParaDiGM comes from the use of parallel search trees.
For search on points mainly octrees are used. The bounding box tree is used to store and to search on mesh elements.

<br/><br/>

### Parallel I/O

When we talked about the reason to be of **ParaDiGM** earlier, we talked about **pario** for parallel I/O as a wrapping to MPI-IO.
Naturally, this feature is retained in the code. The parallel mesh writer in **ParaDiGM** is available for the Ensight format.
It is used to write the mesh interfaces during coupling in CWIPI as well as writing output meshes in CEDRE.
